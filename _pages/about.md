Welcome to the **Back to Kellyville Public School Campaign**. We are a dedicated group of parents, residents, and concerned citizens from Kellyville, NSW, united by a common goal: to ensure our children can attend their local school, Kellyville Public School (KPS), safely and without disruption.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to reinstate the original catchment area for KPS. The recent decision to change the catchment area has forced our children to attend Beaumont Hills Public School (BHPS), which poses several issues:

- **Safety Concerns:** The new route requires children to cross dangerous roads like Samantha Riley Drive, known for its accident history.
- **Community Disruption:** Families who have been part of the KPS community for over 25 years are now being separated, breaking long-standing friendships and community bonds.
- **Educational Impact:** KPS is known for its strong academic performance, while BHPS has experienced declining enrolments and lower academic results.
- **Zoning Inconsistencies:** The new zoning excludes areas closer to KPS while including those further away, causing confusion and frustration.

### How You Can Help

We need your support to make our voices heard. Here’s how you can get involved:

- **Sign the Petition:** Join over 400 residents who have already signed our petition to bring back KPS as our catchment.
- **Spread the Word:** Share our campaign with your friends, family, and neighbors to help us amplify our message.
- **Contact Decision-Makers:** Reach out to the NSW Department of Education and Deputy Premier Prue Car to demand action.

Together, we can fight for our children’s safety, education, and the preservation of our community ties. Thank you for your support.
