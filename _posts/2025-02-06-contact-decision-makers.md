Subject: Urgent - Community Concerns Regarding Kellyville Public School Catchment Changes

Dear Deputy Premier Prue Car,

I am writing to acknowledge receipt of your response, which was forwarded by Taka Bodiam on your behalf in reply to my initial correspondence. Regrettably, I must express my disappointment with the template response provided, which fails to address the specific concerns and suggestions I raised.

It is concerning that the same generic response has been sent to all individuals, including our MP, Mr Ray Williams. This lack of direct engagement undermines the critical issues we have presented and suggests a reluctance from your office and the Department of Education to actively address the pressing challenges our community faces.

During our meeting with Mr Ray Williams and Mr Matt Fuller, Director of Educational Leadership for the Ponds Network, nearly 100 residents gathered to discuss our community’s concerns. A petition signed by close to 400 residents further highlights the widespread opposition to the recent rezoning decision, which unfairly excludes our community from the Kellyville Public School (KPS) catchment area.

Lack of Forward Planning to Address Capacity Issues
Bella Vista Public School, built in 2019, is already over capacity, yet the Department of Education has neither expanded its capacity nor built new schools to accommodate the growing populations of Kellyville and Bella Vista. From our discussions with Mr Fuller, it is evident that rezoning is being used as a temporary solution to an escalating problem, redirecting students to already strained schools such as Kellyville Public School, Matthew Pearce Public School, and Crestwood Public School.

Our community of 400 homes has been unjustly excluded from the KPS catchment, despite its proximity and the safe route it offers for our children to attend school. Your acknowledgment of high growth in these areas underscores the necessity for proactive planning and investment. The fluctuations in population cited in your response fail to reflect the consistent growth projected for Kellyville and Bella Vista. Relying on rezoning, rather than addressing school capacity issues through long-term planning, places undue risks on our primary school children, who now face hazardous routes to their newly designated school, Beaumont Hills Public School (BHPS).

Safety Concerns
Forcing our children to cross a dangerous four-lane road such as Samantha Riley Drive—a road with 32 recorded accidents between 2019 and 2023—is unacceptable. Children, as the most vulnerable road users, should not have their safety compromised for logistical convenience.

Contradiction with the Active Transport Initiative
The NSW Premier’s 2024 Active Transport Initiative, which aims to promote walking and cycling to local schools, cannot be achieved under the current zoning arrangement. If our children remained in the KPS catchment, they could safely walk to school, in alignment with this initiative. Instead, the Department is planning to implement a costly and potentially unsafe school bus service. School buses are not immune to accidents, and the absence of seatbelts and adequate supervision heightens the risks.

Community and Social Impact
The rezoning decision divides our community, forcing children to attend school away from their local friends and neighbourhood. This disruption to established social bonds has a detrimental effect on their social development and well-being.

Educational Impact
While we are proud of the high standards of all NSW public schools, Kellyville Public School’s consistently strong academic performance, as reflected in its NAPLAN results, makes it a highly sought-after school for our community. While NAPLAN is not the sole indicator of educational quality, it serves as an important measure of outcomes. The shift to BHPS, which has a lower enrolment and a less favourable local reputation, is a significant concern for parents who wish to ensure the best possible education for their children.

Community Engagement and Proposed Solutions
At our recent meeting, it was widely agreed that the most reasonable and immediate solution is to reinstate our community within the KPS catchment area, while the affected Bella Vista community returns to Bella Vista Public School. Additionally, expanding local school capacities to accommodate growth is imperative.

Our community is committed to ensuring our children have access to a safe, high-performing school with a strong reputation. The unanimous sentiment is clear: the immediate reinstatement of our community within the KPS catchment area is essential.

Future Planning
Kellyville and Bella Vista continue to experience rapid growth, with annual rates of 0.66% and 3.1%, respectively. The ongoing development in the Metro Precinct further underscores the urgent need for proactive planning to expand school capacities and accommodate the increasing population.

We strongly urge you to reconsider the catchment changes and reinstate our community within the KPS catchment area. This decision will ensure the safety, educational quality, and community cohesion that our children deserve.

We also respectfully request an opportunity to meet with you directly to discuss these concerns. Over 100 residents would welcome the chance to engage in dialogue and seek a constructive resolution.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your response and a meaningful resolution.

Kind regards,

Subject: Strong Opposition to Kellyville Public School Catchment Rezoning

Dear Mr Fuller,

I am writing to express my continued concern and disappointment over the recent rezoning of the Kellyville Public School (KPS) catchment, which unfairly excludes our community of 400 homes. This letter serves to complement my previous letter dated 22/01/25 and seeks to provide further clarity on a key concern I raised. I trust that your forthcoming response will address each concern in detail, including the specific rationale and reasoning behind this particular decision to remove our part of Kellyville and not another part of Kellyville that is farther from KPS.

Specifically, I wish to understand the rationale for excluding our part of Kellyville—bordered by Pool Road, Samantha Riley Drive, and Windsor Road—from the KPS catchment area.

Our area is located approximately 1.5 km from KPS, yet zones have been extended to include areas such as Lewis John Drive, which is approximately 3 km away from KPS. Additionally, it is noteworthy that Parklea Public School, which is a closer alternative for areas like Lewis John Drive, has experienced a decline in enrolments over the past decade (despite a catchment adjustment in March 2023) and has available capacity. However, this factor does not appear to have been considered in the zoning decision-making process.

The apparent inconsistency in the application of these zoning changes has raised further concerns within our community about the transparency and fairness of the process, leading to a perception of discrimination. I respectfully request a specific and tailored response to this key concern, alongside a detailed explanation of other points raised in my earlier correspondence dated 22/01/25.

Your attendance at the December community meeting, alongside nearly 100 residents and our MP, Mr Ray Williams, was appreciated. However, the subsequent generic responses received from your department, including correspondence from Mr Taka Bodiam, fail to adequately address the specific concerns and suggestions raised by the community. This lack of direct engagement undermines the critical issues at hand and suggests a reluctance to actively resolve the challenges we face.

Since the meeting, the online petition opposing this rezoning has gained close to 400 signatures, highlighting the widespread opposition to this decision. Below, I reiterate our key concerns and urge your department to reconsider this unfair rezoning decision.
	1.	Safety Concerns
Forcing young children to cross Samantha Riley Drive—a hazardous four-lane road with 32 recorded accidents between 2019 and 2023—poses a significant safety risk. The walk to Beaumont Hills Public School (BHPS) is not only unsafe but also unsuitable for young children and elderly guardians due to the challenging uphill route. In contrast, KPS offers a safer, more accessible journey.
	2.	Discrimination and Inconsistency
It is baffling that parts of Kellyville farther from KPS (e.g., Lewis John Drive) remain in the catchment, while our community, located within walking distance, is excluded. This inconsistency is discriminatory and undermines the principle of equitable access to local public schools.
	3.	Impact on Community and Social Bonds
This change disrupts the established social bonds and friendships our children have formed within the community, forcing them to attend a school away from their neighbourhood peers. Such division is detrimental to their social development and overall well-being.
	4.	Educational Concerns
While all NSW public schools strive to deliver quality education, KPS has consistently demonstrated strong academic performance, as reflected in its NAPLAN results. The shift to BHPS, with lower enrolments and a less favourable local reputation, raises concerns among parents about the quality of education their children will receive.
	5.	Contradiction with Active Transport Initiative
The NSW Premier’s 2024 Active Transport Initiative aims to encourage walking and cycling to local schools. By excluding our community from the KPS catchment, this initiative is undermined, as our children could have safely walked to KPS. Instead, a costly and potentially unsafe school bus service is being proposed, which does not align with this policy.
	6.	Lack of Planning for Capacity Issues
The rezoning appears to be a short-term solution to address capacity issues at Bella Vista Public School (BVPS), which opened in 2019 and is already over capacity. The department’s failure to plan for growth in Kellyville and Bella Vista has now unfairly penalised our community, while schools like Matthew Pearce Public School have received capacity upgrades.
	7.	Traffic Congestion
The change will exacerbate traffic congestion on Samantha Riley Drive, adding chaos to an already overburdened road network.

Proposed Solutions
At the December meeting, the most reasonable and immediate solution was identified:
	•	Reinstating our community within the KPS catchment.
	•	Returning the affected Bella Vista community to the BVPS catchment.

This solution respects community ties, ensures safety, and aligns with the principles of fairness and equity. Additionally, the Department of Education must prioritise expanding local school capacities to accommodate the growing population in Kellyville and Bella Vista, rather than relying on rezoning as a temporary fix.

Future Planning
With annual growth rates of 0.66% in Kellyville and 3.1% in Bella Vista, coupled with ongoing development in the Metro Precinct, it is imperative to allocate resources proactively to expand school capacities. Without such planning, similar issues will continue to arise, further straining families and communities.

We strongly urge you to reconsider the catchment changes and reinstate our community within the Kellyville Public School catchment. If this change is not actioned, we demand a meeting with the Hon. NSW Deputy Premier, Ms Prue Car, to address these critical issues.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your reply and a thorough resolution of these concerns.

Kind regards,
