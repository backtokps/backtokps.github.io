Subject: Strong Opposition to Kellyville Public School Catchment Rezoning

Dear Mr Fuller,

I am writing to express my continued concern and disappointment over the recent rezoning of the Kellyville Public School (KPS) catchment, which unfairly excludes our community of 400 homes. This decision has caused significant distress and division, impacting the safety, educational quality, and community cohesion of our children.

Your attendance at the December community meeting, alongside nearly 100 residents and our MP, Mr Ray Williams, was appreciated. However, the subsequent generic responses received from your department, including correspondence from Mr Taka Bodiam, fail to adequately address the specific concerns and suggestions raised by the community. This lack of direct engagement undermines the critical issues at hand and suggests a reluctance to actively resolve the challenges we face.

Since the meeting, the online petition opposing this rezoning has gained close to 400 signatures, highlighting the widespread opposition to this decision. Below, I reiterate our key concerns and urge your department to reconsider this unfair rezoning decision.
	1.	Safety Concerns
Forcing young children to cross Samantha Riley Drive—a hazardous four-lane road with 32 recorded accidents between 2019 and 2023—poses a significant safety risk. The walk to Beaumont Hills Public School (BHPS) is not only unsafe but also unsuitable for young children and elderly guardians due to the challenging uphill route. In contrast, KPS offers a safer, more accessible journey.
	2.	Discrimination and Inconsistency
It is baffling that parts of Kellyville farther from KPS (e.g., Lewis Jones Drive) remain in the catchment, while our community, located within walking distance, is excluded. This inconsistency is discriminatory and undermines the principle of equitable access to local public schools.
	3.	Impact on Community and Social Bonds
This change disrupts the established social bonds and friendships our children have formed within the community, forcing them to attend a school away from their neighbourhood peers. Such division is detrimental to their social development and overall well-being.
	4.	Educational Concerns
While all NSW public schools strive to deliver quality education, KPS has consistently demonstrated strong academic performance, as reflected in its NAPLAN results. The shift to BHPS, with lower enrolments and a less favourable local reputation, raises concerns among parents about the quality of education their children will receive.
	5.	Contradiction with Active Transport Initiative
The NSW Premier’s 2024 Active Transport Initiative aims to encourage walking and cycling to local schools. By excluding our community from the KPS catchment, this initiative is undermined, as our children could have safely walked to KPS. Instead, a costly and potentially unsafe school bus service is being proposed, which does not align with this policy.
	6.	Lack of Planning for Capacity Issues
The rezoning appears to be a short-term solution to address capacity issues at Bella Vista Public School (BVPS), which opened in 2019 and is already over capacity. The department’s failure to plan for growth in Kellyville and Bella Vista has now unfairly penalised our community, while schools like Matthew Pearce Public School have received capacity upgrades.
	7.	Traffic Congestion
The change will exacerbate traffic congestion on Samantha Riley Drive, adding chaos to an already overburdened road network.

Proposed Solutions
At the December meeting, the most reasonable and immediate solution was identified:
	•	Reinstating our community within the KPS catchment.
	•	Returning the affected Bella Vista community to the BVPS catchment.

This solution respects community ties, ensures safety, and aligns with the principles of fairness and equity. Additionally, the Department of Education must prioritise expanding local school capacities to accommodate the growing population in Kellyville and Bella Vista, rather than relying on rezoning as a temporary fix.

Future Planning
With annual growth rates of 0.66% in Kellyville and 3.1% in Bella Vista, coupled with ongoing development in the Metro Precinct, it is imperative to allocate resources proactively to expand school capacities. Without such planning, similar issues will continue to arise, further straining families and communities.

We strongly urge you to reconsider the catchment changes and reinstate our community within the Kellyville Public School catchment. If this change is not actioned, we demand a meeting with the Hon. NSW Deputy Premier, Ms Prue Car, to address these critical issues.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to meaningful dialogue and a constructive resolution.

Kind regards,

**Email Body:** 

```
Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I am writing to express my deep concern about the recent decision to change the catchment area for Kellyville Public School (KPS). This decision forces our children to attend Beaumont Hills Public School (BHPS), which raises serious safety, educational, and community concerns.  

- **Safety:** Children are now required to cross dangerous roads like Samantha Riley Drive, which has a history of accidents.  
- **Education:** KPS has a strong academic record, while BHPS has seen declining enrolments and lower performance.  
- **Community:** Our families have been part of the KPS community for over 25 years, and this decision is tearing apart friendships and bonds.  

I urge you to reinstate the original catchment area for KPS and prioritize the safety and well-being of our children.

**Email Body:**  
```
Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I am writing to highlight the serious safety risks posed by the recent decision to change the catchment area for Kellyville Public School (KPS).  

Our children are now required to cross **Samantha Riley Drive**, a busy four-lane road with a history of accidents. Between 2019 and 2023, there were **32 recorded incidents**, including 4 serious accidents. This is an unacceptable risk for our children, who previously had a safe and straightforward walk to KPS.  

I urge you to reinstate the original catchment area for KPS and ensure that our children can attend their local school safely.
