Dear Mr Fuller,
I am writing to you as an enraged member of the Kellyville community bounded between Poole Road, Windsor Road, and Samantha Riley Drive, who has had their local primary public school catchment changed from Kellyville Public School (KPS) to Beaumont Hills Public School (BHPS). This change has not only caused significant distress and divide for the children of our community, but your response to members of the community on 20 December 2024 has further exacerbated this and fails to provide any solution to bring our catchment back to KPS on a permanent basis where it rightly belongs. I demand a response to every point raised in this letter rather than the ridiculous generic responses received to date that fail to actually respond to each individual.

Your department has failed to acknowledge the safety, educational and community division repercussions of this change. If our catchment is not reinstated back to what it was on a permanent basis then we demand a meeting with the Hon. NSW Deputy Premier, Ms. Prue Car to reinforce the significant safety concerns for our children from this change, the community connection we have to KPS, the safety implications of this change, and the completely viable and rationale solution that we have tabled to you during the community consultation as well as below in this letter.
During the community consultation on 16 December 2024, you directly mentioned three points of note:

1) Community ties for children: You emphatically stated that children belong to grow up and thrive as part of their local community and go to the same local public school alongside their neighbourhood friends. Additionally you recognized that KPS is an important hallmark of our neighbourhood with children going to the school over the past 23 years and a number of people volunteering for various educational and extracurricular initiatives at the school over this time period.

2) Quality of education: You stressed the importance of quality education for our children, and the NAPLAN assessment is a direct reflection of these educational standards. Simply put, a school with a strong NAPLAN ranking observed over a period of time has a better education than one that does not.

3) Investment in school capacity: It is the prerogative of the NSW Department of Education to invest in the upgrade of our public primary schools and cater for additional demand and enrolments at a school in advance of it eventuating to ensure education is not compromised. How is this shortcut solution you have proposed aligned with this? It is utterly ridiculous how you are compromising the livelihood and education of our children.
 
 
Mr Fuller, I demand responses to each of the points mentioned in this letter rather than a useless generic email sent from your department. Please enlighten me:

1) Why are you compromising the safety of our children by forcing them to cross an extremely busy road that has had a known history of accidents (6 including during covid where there was less traffic)? The walk to KPS is very straightforward and significantly safer (no blatant history of accidents compared to the walk to Beaumont Hills).

2) Why are you happy to directly impact the community ties of our children by breaking up their friendships and bonds formed with the other children in their community including those met at day care and preschool? Why are you taking away the joy our children have built up over a number of years whenever they walk past Kellyville Public School, and the sense of belonging and joy they get from seeing that is their school? What is your rationale for creating community divide and not recognizing the important role our community has played in facilitating excellent educational and extracurricular activities at Kellyville Public School over an extended period of time? Simply put, the divide you have created is unacceptable and needs to be reversed.

3) Why are parts of Kellyville far away from KPS (e.g. Lewis Jones Drive) included in the KPS catchment but our section of Kellyville is not even though we are walking distance to the school? This makes no sense and is blatant discrimination. The capacity argument just does not cut it.

4) What is the purpose of the NAPLAN assessment and the role of school rankings? Why are you happy to significantly compromise the educational upbringing of our children by changing their local public school from one of sound educational standard as per the NAPLAN assessment (Kellyville Public School) to one that is simply not of the same NAPLAN standing, which has resulted in consistent falls in enrollments to the school (Beaumont Hills Public School). Simply put, the change in our public school catchment is not a like for like educational change compared to the other changes you have made (e.g. Bella Vista to Kellyville, Bella Vista to Matthew Pearce, Bella Vista to Crestwood). This is completely unacceptable and our community demands reversal of this change.

5) Why is your department not investing in capacity upgrades at both Kellyville Public School and Bella Vista Public School? Why has only Matthew Pearce got funding for upgrades to the school? Your department has had plenty of foresight to see the developments around Norwest and Kellyville and the impact it would have on Bella Vista Public School enrolments, and the school only opened in January 2019. You have failed to adequately account for enrolments despite so much foresight. Why are you now penalizing the educational and community ties of our children instead of investing in additional capacity at both Bella Vista public and Kellyville public?
The other concerns over safety for our children which we have previously raised with you remain, and the evaluation of school bus services is not a viable solution for this. It is disappointing that you have not considered or sought to table the points above with the Hon. NSW Deputy Premier, Ms. Prue Car.
You will note from the consultation on 16 December 2024 that our community demands to be reinstated into the Kellyville Public School catchment, and will not take no for an answer. You also note that the section that was changed from Bella Vista public to Kellyville public catchment wants to be reinstated back to Bella Vista public. If we are being frank, the core issue stems with the government’s poor decision to add in a section of Bella Vista Public School catchment to our area and exclude us. As you heard in the meeting, the Bella Vista Public School parents do not want to attend KPS and would rather stay in their original catchment, and the KPS parents want to stay in our own original catchment. Switching both our communities back to their original respective school catchment would be the most logical solution. Why are you not considering this? Why are you happy to cause chaos amongst our community rather than action this completely reasonable solution?
We demand our community to be permanently reinstated back into the Kellyville Public School catchment, and will not allow the educational standard and community ties of our children to be significantly disrupted due to the shortcomings and failure that your department has shown over a number of years in addressing capacity at Bella Vista public. If this change is not actioned, we demand a meeting with Prue Car so we can table these concerns.

With regards,
Your Name

### **Template 1: General Concern**

**Subject:** Urgent: Reinstate Kellyville Public School as Our Catchment  

**Email Body:** 

```
Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I am writing to express my deep concern about the recent decision to change the catchment area for Kellyville Public School (KPS). This decision forces our children to attend Beaumont Hills Public School (BHPS), which raises serious safety, educational, and community concerns.  

- **Safety:** Children are now required to cross dangerous roads like Samantha Riley Drive, which has a history of accidents.  
- **Education:** KPS has a strong academic record, while BHPS has seen declining enrolments and lower performance.  
- **Community:** Our families have been part of the KPS community for over 25 years, and this decision is tearing apart friendships and bonds.  

I urge you to reinstate the original catchment area for KPS and prioritize the safety and well-being of our children.

**Email Body:**  
```
Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I am writing to highlight the serious safety risks posed by the recent decision to change the catchment area for Kellyville Public School (KPS).  

Our children are now required to cross **Samantha Riley Drive**, a busy four-lane road with a history of accidents. Between 2019 and 2023, there were **32 recorded incidents**, including 4 serious accidents. This is an unacceptable risk for our children, who previously had a safe and straightforward walk to KPS.  

I urge you to reinstate the original catchment area for KPS and ensure that our children can attend their local school safely.  

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.
