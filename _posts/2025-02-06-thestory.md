For over 25 years, our community has been an integral part of **Kellyville Public School (KPS)**. Our children have walked safely to their local school, built lifelong friendships, and thrived in an environment that values education and community.

But in **October 2024**, the NSW Department of Education made a decision that has upended our lives. They changed the catchment area for KPS, excluding our neighborhood and forcing our children to attend **Beaumont Hills Public School (BHPS)**. This decision has left us with serious concerns about our children’s safety, education, and emotional well-being.

## **Why We’re Fighting**

1. **Safety First:**  
   The new catchment requires our children to cross **Samantha Riley Drive**, a busy four-lane road with a history of accidents. Between 2019 and 2023, there were **32 recorded incidents**, including 4 serious accidents. This is an unacceptable risk for our children, who previously had a safe and straightforward walk to KPS.

2. **Community Ties:**  
   Our families have been part of the KPS community for decades. We’ve volunteered at school events, supported extracurricular activities, and built strong bonds with other families. This decision tears apart those bonds and forces our children to leave behind the school they love.

3. **Educational Quality:**  
   KPS has a strong academic reputation, consistently performing well in **NAPLAN** assessments. In contrast, BHPS has seen declining enrolments and lower academic performance. Moving our children to BHPS compromises their education and future opportunities.

4. **Inconsistent Zoning:**  
   The rezoning decision excludes our neighborhood, which is only **1 km** from KPS, while including areas further away, such as **Lewis John Drive** (3 km from KPS). This inconsistency is unfair and discriminatory.
