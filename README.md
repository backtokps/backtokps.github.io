## **Fighting for Our Children’s Safety, Education, and Community Ties**

> *"Our children deserve to attend their local school safely, without compromising their education or the bonds they’ve built with their community."*

We are a community of parents, residents, and concerned citizens in Kellyville, NSW, who are deeply affected by the recent decision to change the catchment area for **Kellyville Public School (KPS)**. This decision forces our children to attend **Beaumont Hills Public School (BHPS)**, a move that compromises their safety, disrupts their education, and severs their ties to a school they love.

We are campaigning to **reinstate the original catchment area for KPS** and ensure that our children can continue to attend their local school without risking their safety or sacrificing the quality of their education.

## **Call to Action**

- **Sign the Petition:** Join over 400 residents who have already signed our petition to bring back KPS as our catchment.  
- **Spread the Word:** Share our campaign with friends, family, and neighbors to amplify our voice.  
- **Contact Decision-Makers:** Reach out to the NSW Department of Education and Deputy Premier Prue Car to demand action.

## **Key Issues**

- **Safety Concerns:** Children are being forced to cross dangerous roads like **Samantha Riley Drive**, which has a history of accidents.  
- **Community Ties:** Families have been part of the KPS community for over 25 years, and this decision is tearing apart friendships and bonds.  
- **Educational Quality:** KPS has a strong academic record, while BHPS has seen declining enrolments and lower performance.  
- **Inconsistent Zoning:** Areas closer to KPS are being excluded, while those further away remain in the catchment.
